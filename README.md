## Overview

We analyze optical structures from an **algorithmic perspective**, examining how their spatial footprint scales with the dimensionality of the mathematical operations they perform, and generalize these findings into **spatial scaling laws** for free-space optics and photonic chips.

    <strong>Simplifying a generic free-space optical system.</strong>
    The thickness scaling law can be reduced from <strong>linear</strong> to <strong>square-root</strong> when the device kernel matrix is designed to exhibit a <strong><em>local sparse</em></strong> structure. 
    Visually, a <strong>sparse</strong> matrix has significantly fewer couplings than a dense one. In a <strong>local</strong> kernel matrix, all couplings are only slightly inclined from vertical, whereas nonlocal kernels lack this feature.

    <strong>Simplifying a generic two-dimensional photonic chip</strong> based on a mesh of Machâ€“Zehnder interferometers (MZIs).
    The block-diagonalization, understood from a graph perspective, breaks the kernel matrix into a <strong>linear number</strong> of small, decoupled complete bipartite graphs, each of which requires a constant number of MZIs to implement. When each block is sufficiently small, block-diagonalization reduces the total number of required MZIs from <strong>quadratic</strong> to <strong>quasi-linear</strong>.

We also develop **optics-specific neural pruning techniques** that systematically simplify optical neural networks (ONNs), fundamentally reducing their spatial scaling while **maintaining performance comparable to conventional designs**.  
A variety of **pruned, space-efficient ONNs** are demonstrated, spanning a wide range of architectures from multilayer perceptrons to edge models (**MobileNet**) and computer vision models (**Faster R-CNN**). Our theoretical and computational results reveal a **trend of diminishing returns on accuracy as ONN structure size increases**, highlighting that the ultimate limit of optical computing lies in **an optimal balance between device size and accuracy**.
